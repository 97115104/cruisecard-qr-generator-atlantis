# Atlantis Cruise Card

## Overview
Atlantis Cruise Card helps people on a cruise more easily connect with each other. The app generates QR codes that encode `.vcf` (vCard) contact data so scanners can import a new contact locally, without requiring Internet access.

You can also generate a custom lock-screen wallpaper containing your QR code, enabling others to scan scanr directly from your phone's lock screen.

## Key Points
- Purpose: make in-person contact sharing easier on the boat (offline-friendly).
- QR format: encodes vCard (`.vcf`) data so most phones will import the scanned contact as a new contact.
- Contact photo: the QR contact does not include a photo because Android and iOS handle contact-photo import inconsistently; omitting photos improves compatibility and reliability.
- Lock-screen generator: choose themes or upload a wallpaper, place the QR, then download a ready-to-use image to set as your phone wallpaper.
- Year handling: any year text shown in the UI is computed dynamically (not hard-coded), so it will remain correct over time.
- License: free and open source (MIT).

## Features
- Responsive web UI for mobile and desktop
- Generate vCard QR codes from user-provided fields
- Add custom fields (URLs, handles) to your vCard
- Lock-screen wallpaper generator with several themes and photo-based backgrounds
- Images are preloadable and can be exported as a PNG wallpaper

## Usage
1. Navigate to https://cruisecard.gay in a browser (ideally Safari or DuckDuckGo on mobile).
2. Fill in your name, cabin, and any optional fields.
3. Click "Generate" to produce the QR code (it appears on-screen as a canvas).
4. Optionally choose "Create Custom Lock Screen Wallpaper" to design a wallpaper with your QR and download it.

Notes:
- The QR encodes vCard data; scanning will typically prompt the scanner to import a contact.
- Because contact-photo imports are unreliable across platforms, this generator does not embed a contact photo in the vCard.
- Downloading the final lock screen image on mobile Chrome browsers is unreliable because of Chrome mobile security restrictions. To avoid this, download the image by long-pressing and clicking "Save" or use a different browser such as Safari or DuckDuckGo on mobile. You can also use a desktop browser and send the image to your mobile device.

## Technology
- Plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript (no build step required)
- `qrcodejs` for QR generation
- Canvas-based rendering for wallpaper creation
